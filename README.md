This is a simple neural network that pulls from the MINIST database of poorly drawn 28x28 images of numbers. It will then try to guess what number it is based on 100 batches o 32 training images

If you are using a lower-end device plesse consider using gooogle collab as it does take a up a bit of resources.

INSTUCTIONS:

1. Run sigmoid.py for downloading of data and to obtain weights and bias
2. Make sure the weights and bias are stored in approprate .npy files
3. Run brain_eate.py to see if the network was able to guess the number correctly!
